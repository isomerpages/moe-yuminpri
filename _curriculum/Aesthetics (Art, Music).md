<center> Music Curriculum </center>

The school believes that every child is a Champion in his way. There is arts talent in every pupil waiting to be discovered. We aim to build the character of our pupils, challenge their minds and enrich their lives by engaging them through the arts. With the arts engagement and enrichment, we are confident that our pupils will realise their talents and excel in the arts forms of their choice and interest. Through Yumin 6-year developmental arts education, our pupils will apply the arts skills learnt and contribute back to the community, hence bringing joy and meaning to the lives of others 

  

In Yumin , we focus not only on the product of learning but also the process of learning. We believe in providing quality learning experiences that develops pupil’s interest and talents and empowers them to appreciate and participate in the creation of Art and Music piece.  We want our pupils to acquire knowledge and skills for creative expression through arts creation as well as to demonstrate appreciation for arts of various cultures. Pupils participate in various purposefully designed Arts activities to hone their arts and 21st Century skills and apply the skills learnt for performances and creation.

  

During lessons, pupils can express through performances and share their learning based on their learning experiences. 

  
  

**Assembly Programmes (P1-P6)**  

Our Arts Assembly Programmes aim to expose pupils to the 4 different arts forms - Music, Visual Art, Dance and Theatre and increase their appreciation of the various art forms.

  

Through the different assembly programmes, our Yumin champions learn about important values and increase their appreciation of cultural diversity. In addition, they gain knowledge on the different types of arts form such as learning about instruments from the orchestra. 

**Yumin Art and Music Festival** 

Yumin Art & Music Festival (YAMF) provides a great platform for students from P1 – P6 to showcase their Art or Music talents and skills  and hence build their confidence. Students look forward to having the opportunity to  present their learning, be it in Art or Music,  to their peers. Through this, different music and art genres are also introduced to our pupils.

  

In addition, there are also opportunities for pupils to explore and create Arts beyond classroom. Pupils are able to participate in the fun activities conducted during recess and demonstrate their arts creativity and talents.

**Theatre Experience (P1 & P2)**  

The Primary Ones and Twos will have a fun and enriching theatre experience. Not only do they get to enjoy a wonderful performance, they also have the chance to learn and apply the school values as well as practice theatre etiquette.

  


**Aesthetics Night**


Aesthetics Night is a platform for our students to apply their learning and showcase their talents to their family members. Through this platform, we want to build our students’ confidence on stage and develop our Yumin Champions into Confident & Effective Communicators through the Arts.

**“OUR DREAM” Musical** 

Our school presented our musical, entitled “Our Dream”, featuring students from the Performing Arts Groups including Drama Club, Choir, Creative Movement and Dance, Guzheng Ensemble and String Ensemble as well as artworks from Art Club members. This musical captured the collective dreams and aspirations of our students and staff and inspired us to strive for our dreams as we envision our next stage of growth.  This musical also provided a unique learning experience for our students to build their character and confidence as they developed a sense of pride and accomplishment after their months of hard work and praiseworthy efforts.

In Yumin, we take on a developmental approach to our Music curriculum. Through the Teaching – Reinforcement – Application (TRA) teaching pedagogy, pupils participate in a variety of music activities and acquire music knowledge and skills.
