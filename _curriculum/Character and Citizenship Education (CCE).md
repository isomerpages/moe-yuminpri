In our efforts to nurture students who are caring and gracious citizens, Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) in Yumin is delivered through a 3-Phase TRA approach; Teaching, Reinforcement and Application. This is in line with MOE’s CCE learning outcomes and 21st Century Competencies. The teaching of CCE is developmental and progressive, with structured programmes for each level.
