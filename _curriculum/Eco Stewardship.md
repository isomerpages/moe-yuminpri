In 2022, Eco Stewardship was formed to educate and promote eco friendly lifestyle to students, staff and the community. Closely following the MOE Eco Stewardship plan, Yumin Primary School conservation efforts focus on the 4C, namely curriculum, culture, campus and community.

**Our Programmes**

<center> Recycling @ Yumin! </center>

In Yumin Primary School, we have placed the Roving Vending Machine (RVM) at the heritage corner.  
  
Proper ways of recycling (washing and drying of PET bottles and cans) were shared to all students and staff. Everyone in Yumin Primary are encouraged to recycle PET bottles and aluminium cans. We can even bring the bottles and cans from home to recycle!

<center> World Water Day </center>

On Tuesday 22 March, we celebrated World Water Day! Water is a precious resource and every droplet of water counts! Students were challenged to design a poster to promote the ways of using less water and how precious water is. Selected Eco Champs were also invited to attend the annual World Water Day symposium. Our Eco Champs were then tasked to spread the importance of saving water to their friends.

In the month of May, we held the annual Biodiversity Week in our school! Students were encouraged to observe the organisms that were brought in. Students were also invited to use the iNaturalist app to find out the scientific name of the species.

P1 to P3 students learned more about Singapore’s rich biodiversity using the thematic Bobby and Stella book. P4 to P6 students were tasked to explore the school gardens and record the organisms that they sighted during the Bioblitz programme.

<center> Collaborations with other Subjects </center>

  
  
Environment education is only effective when it’s a whole school approach. The Eco Stewardship team collaborated with other subjects to further enhance environment education in the respective subjects.
