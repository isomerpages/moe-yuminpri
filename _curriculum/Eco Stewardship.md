In 2022, Eco Stewardship was formed to educate and promote eco friendly lifestyle to students, staff and the community. Closely following the MOE Eco Stewardship plan, Yumin Primary School conservation efforts focus on the 4C, namely curriculum, culture, campus and community.

**Our Programmes**

Recycling @ Yumin!

In Yumin Primary School, we have placed the Roving Vending Machine (RVM) at the heritage corner.  
  
Proper ways of recycling (washing and drying of PET bottles and cans) were shared to all students and staff. Everyone in Yumin Primary are encouraged to recycle PET bottles and aluminium cans. We can even bring the bottles and cans from home to recycle!
