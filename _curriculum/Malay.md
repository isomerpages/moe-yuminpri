The Malay Language Department includes the aspect of Joy of Learning into our curriculum. To better cater to all students, we inculcate their interest in learning the Malay language and culture through innovative ways of teaching. Aside from using Information and Communications Technology (ICT) tools, which are prevalent amongst the students in this 21st century, our department has customised and unique packages.

**Key Programmes & Learning Experiences**

**Taman Herba Arif Budiman Cilik**

  

The Malay Department has put together a physical herb garden alongside an official website. The official website features the plants that are common and prominent in the Malay community.

  

The website and the garden were officially launched by the School Leaders in Term 1 Week 10. The Malay students from various levels were brought down by their respective Malay teachers to visit the garden for an enriching outdoor learning thereafter complete some follow-up activities in the computer lab.

  

The purpose of the Taman Herba Arif Budiman Cilik website is to make customized information available for our students. It is also part of the Malay Department’s effort in contributing towards cyber wellness for the students, by taking ownership of the cyber contents shared with students.

  

The information on the website is tailored to suit the needs of the students and also teachers to create the best feasible experiential learning.
