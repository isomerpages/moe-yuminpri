**Student Testimonial**  
“Joining the Art Club has allowed me to express myself through the various art forms and colours. I learnt that colours can affect a person’s mood. As for me, I love bright colours in my artwork. Doing artwork requires passion and patience. I love being a part of the Art Club family!”

“My two years in the Art Club have been very enriching. I have gained knowledge on different types of Art work and my artistic skills have also improved. Other than drawing and painting, I am also exposed to craftwork such as wire sculpting. My friends and I created several wire sculptures for the Singapore Youth Festival Central Judging competition earlier this year. The experience that I gained in taking part in the competition has further motivated me in my artistic quest.”
