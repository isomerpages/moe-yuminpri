**Students’ Testimonials**

**“I love Choir as we get to learn to sing new songs every other week. The songs we learn are usually melodious and soothing. I have also learnt more about Music since I joined Choir”**

**_Sheetal (6 Compassion)_**

**“Choir opens doors for me to participate in performances.  When I was in Primary 4, I was given the opportunity to take part in the Singapore Youth Festival competition.  I felt very thankful as the competition has allowed me to be more resilient in practising my singing skills.”**
