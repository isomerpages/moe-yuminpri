**Student Testimonial**  

“Dancing has always been my passion. Even though I have to train and practise for long hours, I still love every minute of it. Our hard work and effort paid off when we clinched the prestigious Gold Award at the 2012 Singapore Youth Festival Central Judging competition.  
Creative Movement and Dance has made me realise the existence of many kinds of wonderful dances such as modern, international and contemporary dances. When I am dancing, I feel very relaxed.”
