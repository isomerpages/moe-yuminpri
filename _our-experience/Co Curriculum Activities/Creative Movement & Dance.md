**Student Testimonial**  

Since I was young, I have been passionate about dancing. Joining Creative Movement &amp; Dance CCA has taught me so much. It's not just about learning dance moves, I had gained skills and values which I could not pick up anywhere else. Our coaches and teachers not only taught us dance, but also had taught us the importance of discipline, teamwork and perseverance. Despite the challenges, I enjoyed every single lesson. I had so many supportive friends who had my back. Creative Movement &amp; Dance CCA has also shaped my into a better person and a better dancer. Attaining a Certificate of Accomplishment in the 2024 SYF AP was the result of our hard work and dedication.
