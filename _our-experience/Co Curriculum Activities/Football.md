“Football has helped me improve my fitness, as well as my decision-making and leadership skills. It has also helped me with my confidence. I have picked up the school values of respect, compassion, integrity and perseverance through the game.”

**_Syed Amir of P6 Respect_**

  

  

“Being chosen to be the captain of the football team is an honour. I have more responsibility on my shoulders and be a good example to the rest of my teammates. For me, respect goes both ways; if I respect my teammates, they will respect me too. Having a positive mindset drives me and my teammates to keep going, through the tough games and trainings. Overall, football has helped me improve my fitness and developed my character.”
