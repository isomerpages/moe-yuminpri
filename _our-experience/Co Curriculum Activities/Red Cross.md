**Student Testimonial**  

“_My four years with the Red Cross have been a fulfilling learning journey. I have learnt values such as respect and perseverance through my CCA. We were also taught first aid skills and one of the skills that I enjoyed learning most is the different types of bandaging. Engaging in team games weekly makes this CCA lively and fun. I feel proud and happy to be a Red Cross member._&nbsp;”
