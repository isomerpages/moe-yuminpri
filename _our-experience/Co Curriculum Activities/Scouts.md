**Student Testimonial**  

“_I am in Scouts because I enjoy the many interesting activities like hiking and Job Week. During Job Week, I learnt how to be bold and ask for jobs politely. Joining Scouts has enabled me to get to know many people and develop meaningful friendships. When we go for camps, we also get to make friends with Scouts from other schools. A scout is loyal and trustworthy. Joining Scouts was the best decision I have ever made._”
