**Student Testimonial**  

_“Being in the String Ensemble has been a great and interesting experience for me. Nothing beats being in a CCA that develops my interest in music and helps me discover my hidden talent at playing the violin. I recently took the ABRSM violin examination and it was a very good experience.”_  

**_Verani Wu Huiling (4B)_**  
  
_“I enjoy being in String Ensemble as I have built great friendships with my CCA friends. We perform together for special events such as National Day and Teachers’ Day.&nbsp;  
My friends and I find it challenging learning to play new songs. However, as we practise more, we eventually become better. I intend to be a dedicated member of the String Ensemble and continue to hone my skills.”_
