##### **Vision**
A Champion who Appreciates and Expresses Creativity through the Arts, contributing to a Vibrant School Arts Culture

##### **Key Programmes**

Music Curriculum

The school believes that every child is a Champion in his way. There is arts talent in every pupil waiting to be discovered. We aim to build the character of our pupils, challenge their minds and enrich their lives by engaging them through the arts. With the arts engagement and enrichment, our pupils will realise their talents and excel in the arts forms of their choice and interest.
  

Through Yumin 6-year developmental arts education and by focusing on not only the product of learning but also the process of learning, our pupils will acquire knowledge and skills for creative expression through arts creation as well as to demonstrate appreciation for arts of various cultures.


Tapping on experiential learning and inquiry-based learning, pupils are provided with opportunities to be engaged in the breadth of experiences through wide range and variety of arts programmes, be enriched with (development and progression to deepen students' development of knowledge and skills) and excel in the Arts.

1. Arts Assembly Programmes
2. Yumin Art and Music Festival (Flourishing Artists and Flourishing Performers)
3. Enrichment Programmes to learn from Arts Specialists
4. Museum-based Learning
5. Talent Development through CCAs (SYF Arts Presentations and Art Exhibition)
