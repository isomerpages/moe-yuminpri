<p><strong>The Facilitation Process</strong>
</p>
<p>Effective facilitation of CCE lessons and learning experiences require
the use of a questioning process and an understanding of the teaching approaches.</p>
<p>The guiding questions provided in the lesson ideas are founded on the
CSI process of questioning. CSI refers to the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Clarify students’ thoughts &amp; feelings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sensitise them by inviting them to put themselves in the shoes of others</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Influence them to make the right decisions</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions guide the facilitation process by scaffolding students’
thinking, and helping them to clarify their values and beliefs.&nbsp; Based
on students’ responses, teachers can guide students to examine their motives
behind their decisions or actions, and to take on others-centred perspectives.&nbsp;
Figure 1 provides suggested questions based on the CSI process of questioning.&nbsp;
Teachers have the flexibility to sequence, customize and build on the suggested
questions to elicit understanding.</p>

<p><strong>Core Skills in CCE</strong>
</p>
<p>The effective use of the CSI questioning technique and the application
of the different process-based approaches help students in their development
of the four core CCE skills.&nbsp; They are:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moral Reasoning
<br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perspective Taking
<br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reflection
<br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Responsible Decision-Making
<br>
</p>
<p><em>Moral Reasoning</em>
</p>
<p>The skill of Moral Reasoning enables students to examine their motives
behind decisions, and thus progress from a self-centred perspective to
a higher stage of moral development that focuses on societal and universal
perspectives.&nbsp; Students examine their motives behind a decision and
consider the common good when deciding what the right thing to do is.</p>
<p><em>Perspective Taking</em>
</p>
<p>The skill of Perspective Taking involves adopting the viewpoint of another
person, and requires one to see a situation in different ways.&nbsp; It
forms the basis for understanding people’s behavior (Johnson, 1975).&nbsp;
The ability to take perspectives enables our students to develop empathy
and help them form positive relationships.&nbsp; It also encourages them
to be proactive in helping others.</p>
<p><em>Reflection</em>
</p>
<p>The skill of Reflection involves being&nbsp; able to look back at a situation
or experience, ponder over it, learn from it, and apply this learning in
future relevant situations.&nbsp; Through Reflection, students connect
their learning to their life experiences.</p>
<p><em>Responsible Decision-Making</em>
</p>
<p>The skill of Responsible Decision-Making involves making well-considered
decisions based on a sound value system that includes values upheld by
society.&nbsp; In making responsible decisions, our students will be able
to consider the consequences of their decisions and choose options that
will have a positive impact on others.</p>
