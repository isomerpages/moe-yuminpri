**The Facilitation Process**
        

Effective facilitation of CCE lessons and learning experiences require the use of a questioning process and an understanding of the teaching approaches.

The guiding questions provided in the lesson ideas are founded on the CSI process of questioning. CSI refers to the following:

* Clarify students’ thoughts & feelings
* Sensitise them by inviting them to put themselves in the shoes of others
* Influence them to make the right decisions

These questions guide the facilitation process by scaffolding students’ thinking, and helping them to clarify their values and beliefs.  Based on students’ responses, teachers can guide students to examine their motives behind their decisions or actions, and to take on others-centred perspectives.  Figure 1 provides suggested questions based on the CSI process of questioning.  Teachers have the flexibility to sequence, customize and build on the suggested questions to elicit understanding.

**National Education**

National Education (NE) is an important part of our holistic education. We aim to develop national cohesion, cultivate the instinct for survival as a nation and instil in our students, confidence in our nation's future. It also emphasises on cultivating a sense of belonging and emotional rootedness to Singapore. Moving forward, we can anchor NE not on the delivery of messages but on the design of experiences that strengthen our students’ and fellow educators’ citizenship dispositions, to inspire all of us to take collective ownership of our future as a nation.
