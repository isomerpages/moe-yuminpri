**FRAMEWORK & PEDAGOGICAL APPROACHES**



 **Modular Curriculum Structure**  

The modular Chinese Language curriculum structure caters to the unique needs and abilities of students during their Primary School years. Students will take the Core Module which occupies approximately 80% of CL curriculum time.

**Core Module**

To develop listening and speaking skills

**Three CL Teaching Approach**

_Listen and Speak More_ 

More opportunities for listening and speaking are created to encourage students to express themselves. Through active participation in classroom activities, students develop a strong foundation in oral communication.

_Recognise Characters Effectively_ 

Students will learn useful strategies to help them recognise and remember characters effectively, and to adapt these strategies towards learning new characters to suit their needs.

_Follow on with Reading and Writing_ 

Character recognition facilitates early reading and motivates students to learn the language well. students will learn scriptwriting at the lower Primary levels and gradually pick up essay writing skills at the higher Primary levels. 

  

  

**KEY PROGRAMMES & LEARNING EXPERIENCES**


**Mother Tongue Fortnight (MTF) & Chinese Language Camp**

With the objective of ‘Active Learners, Proficient Users’ in mind, the Chinese Department create more opportunities for students to be exposed to Chinese culture and values, and also to enhance their learning of the Chinese Language (CL).

During the MT Fortnight & Language Camp, the activities are multi-disciplinary integrating subjects such as English, Physical Education, Art, Music, Drama, and Character and Citizenship Education (CCE). The learning of CL is thus made more fun, engaging and effective through multi-disciplinary settings. These activities arouse students’ interest in learning Chinese culture and better equip them with the varied use of the language in different contexts. Students learn to be more confident, adaptable, innovative, and resilient.

  

为了贯彻执行教育部所推行的“母语双周”计划，今年育民小学在第一学段就结合华人农历新年 ( 第一周 ) ，为一年级至六年级的华族学生举办了一系列丰富多彩的母语双周活动。农历新年期间，小一至小三的学生尝试制作华族传统食品汤圆，小四至小六的学生则尝试包饺子的活动。除了华族学生之外，异族同胞也和我们一起庆祝农历新年，感受新年气氛。  
  
此外学校也举办了硬笔书法比赛、华文书展和语文轮盘游戏等等，华文俱乐部的同学也到滨海湾参加了“春到河畔知识行”，让他们对农历新年的传统习俗有更深的了解。通过这些活动，学生们了解了更多华族传统文化习俗及来历，因此更加喜爱使用母语。  
  
为了加深学生对华族传统文化的认识，激发他们学习华文华语的兴趣，华文部为三年级华文班的同学举办语文营。在语文营中，将会有结合课文，学生共同参与的游戏，还有在扇子上作画的活动。学生在复习巩固所学的同时，也会对华族传统文化有更深入的了解。

  

**School-based Curriculum – Di Zi Gui ( 弟子规 )**  

Di Zi Gui is an effective approach in cultivating kids’ moral education, it sets the standards for being a good student and child. Chinese Department aims to nurture students with strong values as well as 21st Century competencies at the younger stage. This programme also helps students to understand moral character traits like “Filial Piety”, “Trust”, “Love” and “Kindness”.  To align with the MOE PERI holistic assessment recommendation, students will go through various “bite-sized” forms of assessment at the end of each school term.

  
育民小学正式为一年级与二年级的华族学生进行弟子规的课程。华文部希望借此能够令华族学生的华文程度更上一层楼。此外，也能够把华族的优良传统与正确的价值观灌输给学生。  

  

**Conversational Chinese and Malay (CCM)**

The Conversational Chinese and Malay (CCM) programme are to equip our students with basic skills and knowledge of the Chinese or Malay Language so as to enable them to communicate with their friends and show awareness and appreciation of another culture. It is able to strengthen Singapore’s multi-racial compact. The Mother Tongue department engages professional CCM programme vendors to conduct lessons.
