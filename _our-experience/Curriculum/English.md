<p><strong>JOY OF LEARNING, JOY OF TEACHING</strong>
</p>
<p>Mission: To empower &amp; develop students to be confident, empathetic
and effective communicators.</p>
<p><strong>FRAMEWORK &amp; PEDAGOGICAL APPROACHES</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading (STELLAR 2.0)</strong> In
Yumin, we adopt the recommended STELLAR 2.0 programme which helps to strengthen
studentsâ€™ language skills in areas of reading, listening, speaking and
writing.</p>
<p>Some of the strategies used in the lower primary classrooms include Shared
Book Approach (SBA) and Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA). As
students progress up the levels, teachers reinforce the learning of language
skills through Supported Reading (SR) and Know-Want to know-Learnt (KWL).</p>
<p><strong>MOE Programmes</strong>
<br>These programmes aim to support students in their learning of literacy
skills.</p>

<p><strong>KEY PROGRAMMES &amp; LEARNING EXPERIENCES</strong>
</p>
<p>Our programmes and learning experiences support the development of emerging
21<sup>st </sup>Century Competencies which include critical, adaptive and
inventive thinking, and communication, collaboration and information skills.</p>
<p><strong>Book Character's Day</strong>
<br>Every year, students and staff look forward to a particular day where
they bring characters from their favourite books to life, dressing up and
sharing about these characters with each other. These certainly add even
more colour and vibrancy to the typical school day. We were even featured
on MOE Facebook!</p>

<p><strong>Integrated Outdoor Learning Experiences (iOLE)</strong>
<br>Students from all levels go on exciting learning journeys which support
and enrich the learning of various STELLAR units. For instance, students
visit zones within the Singapore Zoo and River Wonders for exciting and
experiential learning. From these experiences, students are able to apply
their knowledge in creating posters about endangered animals and journal
writing - just to name a few!</p>

reward students for reading a variety of books. It also allows students

<p><strong>One Minute of Fame</strong>
</p>
<p>One Minute of Fame is a platform in which students develop their confidence
in public speaking. It takes place in class regularly and many students
feel empowered to share during recess on the last week of every month.
Students select their own choice of topics or one on the list provided
by their teachers. Through this initiative, students learn and practise
what is takes to become effective public speakers whilst sharing their
thoughts and ideas enthusiastically.</p>

<p><strong>Storytelling Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Our storytelling programme is meticulously designed for our primary 3
students to foster their writing and speaking skills. Across two weeks,
students explore the rich elements of storytelling, including story structure,
character development, and plot enhancement. Through engaging activities
in the classroom and theatrette settings, children learn to express themselves
in Standard English, both vocally and physically. Creativity is encouraged
as each student crafts and presents original stories, enhancing their confidence
and narrative skills in a supportive environment.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Broadcast Journalism Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The broadcast journalism programme is designed to equip primary 4 students
with essential communication and media skills. The curriculum, spread across
two weeks, covers a range of activities from interviewing techniques to
crafting engaging news reports, all tailored to enhance students' communication
skills. Students learn to apply their knowledge in real-world scenarios,
developing both individual and collaborative projects that build confidence
and critical thinking skills. This hands-on approach ensures that students
not only learn the techniques but also understand their practical applications
in the world of broadcast journalism.</p>
