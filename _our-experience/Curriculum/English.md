**JOY OF LEARNING, JOY OF TEACHING**


Empowering & developing students to be confident, empathetic and effective communicators.

**FRAMEWORK & PEDAGOGICAL APPROACHES** 

**Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading (STELLAR)**
In Yumin, we adopt the recommended STELLAR programme which helps to strengthen students’ language skills. Some of the strategies used in the lower primary classrooms include Shared Book Approach (SBA) and Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA). As students progress up the levels, teachers reinforce the learning of language skills through Supported Reading (SR) and Know-Want to know-Learnt (KWL).

  

**MOE Programmes**<br>
These programmes aim to support students in their learning of literacy skills.



| Learning Support Learning Support Programme (LSP) for P1 & P2 students| Reading Remediation Programme (RRP) for P3 & P4 students | School-based Dyslexia Remediation Programme (SDR) for P3 & P4 students |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| LSP is a specialised early intervention programme that provides additional support for students with weaker literacy skills.     | RRP aims to provide support for Pri 3 and Pri4 students who may struggle in reading with understanding.     | Students are identified for support through a systematic screening process for dyslexia conducted at the end of Pri 2.     |

**KEY PROGRAMMES & LEARNING EXPERIENCES**

Here's a snapshot of how our EL Lessons are like:

**Book Character's Day**<BR>
Every year, students and staff look forward to a particular day where they bring characters from their favourite books to life, dressing up and sharing about these characters with each other. These certainly add even more colour and vibrancy to the typical school day. We were even featured on MOE Facebook!

**Intergrated Outdoor Learning Experiences (iOLE)**<br>
Students from all levels go on exciting learning journeys which support and enrich the learning of various STELLAR units. For instance, students visit zones within the Singapore Zoo for exciting and experiential learning. From these experiences, students are able to apply their knowledge in creating posters about endangered animals and journal writing - just to name a few!

**Reading Programme**<br>

Reading Bingo<br>
Reading Bingo is a reading incentive programme designed to motivate and reward students for reading a variety of books. It also allows students to explore books from the school, home and public libraries. Students choose tasks from the choice board to complete and with every five tasks completed, they form one bingo! They will then be awarded a reading badge or stationery pack.

Learning Values through Books & Celebrating Genres<br>
Books are powerful – not only do they allow readers to pick up language skills, they also teach and enable readers to gain insights on values through the characters and circumstances in the story.

  

In 2022, the English Department introduced and celebrated the two genres - Fables and Pourquoi. Not only were students recommended to a variety of books to enable them to appreciate these genres, but the department also showcased texts related to this genre that highlighted the school values. This was a great opportunity for students to identify, explore and internalise the school values while learning about the features of the Fantasy genre.

Not only that, Yumin Champions applied what they had learned about the genres by trying their hand at creating their very own fables and pourquoi tales in the form of stories or comic strips. The response was overwhelming and many of our students proved that they were budding illustrators and writers!

**Speaking Programme**

**One Minute of Fame**<br>
One Minute of Fame is a platform in which students develop their confidence in public speaking. It takes place during recess on the last week of every month. Students select their own choice of topics or one on the list provided by their teachers. Through this initiative, students learn and practise what it takes to become effective public speakers whilst sharing their thoughts and ideas enthusiastically.
