**JOY OF LEARNING, JOY OF TEACHING**


Empowering & developing students to be confident, empathetic and effective communicators.

**Framework & pedagogical approaches**


  

**Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading (STELLAR)**

In Yumin, we adopt the recommended STELLAR programme which helps to strengthen students’ language skills. Some of the strategies used in the lower primary classrooms include Shared Book Approach (SBA) and Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA). As students progress up the levels, teachers reinforce the learning of language skills through Supported Reading (SR) and Know-Want to know-Learnt (KWL).

  

**MOE Programmes**

These programmes aim to support students in their learning of literacy skills.



| Learning Support Learning Support Programme (LSP) for P1 & P2 students| Reading Remediation Programme (RRP) for P3 & P4 students | School-based Dyslexia Remediation Programme (SDR) for P3 & P4 students |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| LSP is a specialised early intervention programme that provides additional support for students with weaker literacy skills.     | RRP aims to provide support for Pri 3 and Pri4 students who may struggle in reading with understanding.     | Students are identified for support through a systematic screening process for dyslexia conducted at the end of Pri 2.     |

**Book Character's Day**

Safe management measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic may have impacted school processes but at Yumin Primary, teachers and students have learned to take the new norm in their stride, adapt, and make the most out of each day. For the school’s 2020 & 2021 Book Character Day, staff and students brought characters from their favourite books to life, dressing up and sharing about these characters with each other. The extra-fun part? They got to meet these characters while performing everyday tasks such as temperature taking, eating during recess, and walking along the corridors! We were even featured on MOE Facebook!
