**JOY OF LEARNING, JOY OF TEACHING**


Empowering & developing students to be confident, empathetic and effective communicators.

**FRAMEWORK & PEDAGOGICAL APPROACHES** 

**Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading (STELLAR)**
In Yumin, we adopt the recommended STELLAR programme which helps to strengthen students’ language skills. Some of the strategies used in the lower primary classrooms include Shared Book Approach (SBA) and Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA). As students progress up the levels, teachers reinforce the learning of language skills through Supported Reading (SR) and Know-Want to know-Learnt (KWL).

  

**MOE Programmes**<br>
These programmes aim to support students in their learning of literacy skills.



| Learning Support Learning Support Programme (LSP) for P1 & P2 students| Reading Remediation Programme (RRP) for P3 & P4 students | School-based Dyslexia Remediation Programme (SDR) for P3 & P4 students |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| LSP is a specialised early intervention programme that provides additional support for students with weaker literacy skills.     | RRP aims to provide support for Pri 3 and Pri4 students who may struggle in reading with understanding.     | Students are identified for support through a systematic screening process for dyslexia conducted at the end of Pri 2.     |

**Book Character's Day**<BR>
Every year, students and staff look forward to a particular day where they bring characters from their favourite books to life, dressing up and sharing about these characters with each other. These certainly add even more colour and vibrancy to the typical school day. We were even featured on MOE Facebook!

**Intergrated Outdoor Learning Experiences (iOLE)**<br>
Students from all levels go on exciting learning journeys which support and enrich the learning of various STELLAR units. For instance, students visit zones within the Singapore Zoo for exciting and experiential learning. From these experiences, students are able to apply their knowledge in creating posters about endangered animals and journal writing - just to name a few!
**Reading Programme**<br>
Learning Values through Books & Celebrating Genres

  

Books are powerful – not only do they allow readers to pick up language skills, they also teach and enable readers to gain insights on values through the characters and circumstances in the story.

  

In 2021, the English Department introduced and celebrated the genre of ‘Fantasy’. Not only were students recommended to a variety of books to enable them to appreciate this genre, but the department also showcased texts related to this genre that highlighted the school values of Perseverance and Integrity. This was a great opportunity for students to identify, explore and internalise the school values while learning about the features of the Fantasy genre.

  

Not only that, Yumin Champions applied what they had learned about fairy tales in the previous term, and tried their hand at creating their very own fractured fairy tales in the form of stories or comic strips. The response was overwhelming and many of our students proved that they were budding illustrators and writers!

  

**Speech & Drama**

Our in-house Speech and Drama Programme (P1 & P2) provides students with an opportunity to learn techniques necessary for effective communication while having fun!

**External Competition**

Moo-O Plus

  

The Moo-O Plus competition is an annual event that aims to cultivate in students, the love for the English Language, and motivate them to read and speak fluently and expressively in English through fun and engaging activities.
