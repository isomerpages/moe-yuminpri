**Information and Communications Technologies or ICT**

We believe that ICT competence is necessary for students who will be living and working in an information based society. Therefore ICT is an integral part of our curriculum. We provide a range of opportunities so that pupils can develop their competence in the use of ICT devices.

Technology is harnessed in support of the school’s Total Curriculum Framework and to deepen subject mastery and develop 21st Century Competencies in our students. We also keep pace with the advances in technology as learning becomes possible anywhere, anytime. We believe that ICT should be embraced as it is a very powerful tool for teaching and learning.



**New Media Literacies**


New Media Literacies are defined as the competencies to create, connect and curate information in the digital networked environment. Regular engagement in these interactions will enable students to develop an understanding of the social practices (tacit norms and skills) governing the Web and be equipped with the knowledge and skills to navigate and participate productively. At the heart of these interactions are the six core values of the 21st Century Competencies (21CC) framework, that anchor the learning experiences and promote discerning and responsible use of technology.

**Cyber Wellness**


Cyber Wellness education focuses on helping your child to be a responsible digital learner. We focus on the well-being of our students as they navigate cyberspace. Our curriculum aims to equip students with the knowledge and skills to harness the power of ICT for positive purposes, maintain a positive presence in cyberspace and be safe and responsible users of ICT.



**The 3 Cyber Wellness Key Messages:**


• Embrace the affordances of technology while maintaining a balanced lifestyle between offline and      online activities.

• Be a safe and responsible user of technology and maintain a positive online presence.

• Be responsible for personal well-being in the cyberspace

  

  

**Support at home**  

Parents play a key role in their children’s growth. Students benefit the most when the home and school environments are attuned to each other. To help your child stay safe and have positive experiences online, you can:

• Activate parental controls on your home devices.

• Model good digital habits for your child.

• Set ground rules for internet use.

• Navigate the internet together to understand their usage.
