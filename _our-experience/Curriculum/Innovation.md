<p><strong>Overview</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Yumin Primary School Innovation committee drives the innovation framework
to promote a school culture of innovation and sustainability excellence.
Adapted on MOE's Eco Stewardship 4C framework, there is infusion of 21<sup>st </sup>CC
skills and STEAM related pedagogies and activities into a four-pronged
Yumin Innovation Framework.</p>

<p><strong>4C: Curriculum</strong>
</p>
<p>The Yumin Innovation Programme focuses on sustainability and STEM projects
across various levels to cultivate essential 21st-century competencies,
as shown in the diagram below.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

<p></p>
<p>Students engage in hands-on learning experiences that promote critical
thinking, problem-solving, and creativity while addressing real-world environmental
challenges. Projects are tailored to each grade level, allowing students
to explore topics such as waste reduction, energy conservation, and the
importance of biodiversity preservation. This interdisciplinary approach
not only enhances students' knowledge but also prepares them for future
challenges in an ever-evolving world.</p>
<p>To provide a thinking routine to help cultivate critical and creative
thinking, the team adapted the Engineering Thinking process and came up
with APP IT, as shown in the diagram below. From Type 1 to Type 3, students
utilise APP IT to understand the problem presented to them and do more
research on it. Students then prototype, test and improve their product.</p>

<p><strong>Type 1</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Catalyst @ Yumin</strong>
</p>
<p>The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) at Yumin Primary School titled Catalyst@Yumin,
focuses on sustainability to equip students with essential 21st-century
competencies. Through programming and tinkering projects, students explore
environmental issues and develop solutions. The program fosters critical
thinking and creativity, preparing students for future challenges while
promoting a sustainable world.</p>
<p>The table below summarises Yumin Primary signature programme, anchoring
on sustainability.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><u>P2 ALP: Be an Eco Thinkerer</u>
</p>
<p>In our P2 ALP program, students learn about reducing and recycling using
recycled cardboard to create a marble maze. This hones their tinkering
skills, fosters creativity and practice problem solving skills.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p><u>P3 ALP: Be a Vermiculturist and Eco Novelist</u>
</p>
<p>During Be a Vermiculturist, students learn about food waste management
and how to code a micro:bit to monitor vermicomposting conditions. This
hands-on experience teaches them about sustainable practices and using
technology to solve real-world problems.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/InnovPic6.jpg">
</div>
<p>The P3 students also explore AI technology during Be an Eco novelist programme.
The students generate images using AI for their self-created stories on
sustainability. This encourages creativity and allows them to visualise
and bring their sustainable narratives to life, enhancing their understanding
of the impact of their actions on the environment.</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>P4 ALP: Be an Eco Creator</u>
</p>
<p>In our P4 ALP program, students focus on reducing and recycling by using
recycled cardboard to create carnival games. They also learn how to code
a micro:bit to track scores for these games, incorporating their P4 science
knowledge on the properties of light. This interdisciplinary approach fosters
innovation and practical application of their learning.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p><u>P5 ALP: Be an Eco Engineer</u>
</p>
<p>In our P5 ALP program, students deepen their understanding of reduce and
recycle by training an AI machine to distinguish between recyclable and
non-recyclable materials. This project enhances their digital literacy
skills, offering a practical application of technology and fostering a
deeper awareness of environmental sustainability and the impact of their
choices.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>P6 ALP: Interest Based Projects (Be an Agriculturist, Be an Eco Designer, Be an Eco Programmer)</strong>
</p>
<p>In our P6 ALP program, students engage in a variety of projects focused
on sustainability and STEM after their PSLE. They have the freedom to choose
their preferred project, allowing them to explore their interests and strengths.</p>
<p>Students can choose between three engaging projects: Be an Agriculturist,
Be an Eco Designer, or Be an Eco Coder. In Be an Agriculturist, students
focus on food sustainability and tend to the school hydroponics system.
In Be an Eco Designer, students upcycle fabric to create tote bags. In
Be an Eco Coder, students use LEGO SPIKE to explore various sustainability
issues and develop innovative solutions.</p>
<p>This initiative fosters critical thinking, innovation, and a deep understanding
of sustainable practices in diverse fields. These diverse opportunities
encourage students to apply their knowledge creatively and contribute a
more sustainable future.</p>

<p><strong>Sustainability Week</strong>
</p>
<p>During sustainability Week, students delve into Singapore's biodiversity
and sustainability challenges through engaging lessons and hands-on activities
in class. Recess is filled with exciting events such as bioblitz, where
students observe local flora and fauna, and sustainability exhibitions
showcasing eco-friendly projects from Be The...Future ALP programme. This
week fosters a deep appreciation for our natural environment.</p>

<p><u>Recycle Right</u>
</p>
<p>Recycle Right is a series of bite sized morning assembly sharing to promote
and encourage proper recycling habits. Teachers, student leaders and Environmental
Club members take turns to curate presentations to teach the student population
on proper recycling habits.</p>

<p><strong>Type 2</strong>
</p>
<p><u>Makerspace Recess Programme</u>
</p>
<p>In our P3 Makerspace program, students are invited to the Makerspace Lab
to create toys using recycled materials during recess. This hands-on experience
hones their tinkering and problem-solving skills while promoting sustainability.
The program encourages creativity and innovation, helping students understand
the value of reusing materials for a more sustainable future.</p>
