<p>Engaging with global and cultural sensitivities through school visits
and cultural experiences is an enriching endeavor that had profoundly impacted
students' perspectives. During this trip, students had an enriching cultural
immersion aimed at fostering cultural understanding while strengthening
bonds with Singapore as they share our traditional games with their peers
in the neighbouring countries. The city tour deepened appreciation for
culture and history of our neighbouring countries. These experiences broadened
horizons, facilitated self-discovery, and foster a more inclusive and globally
aware learning environment, nurturing students' abilities to navigate diverse
perspectives and contribute positively to a multicultural society.</p>
