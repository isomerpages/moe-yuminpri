<h4>Yumin's Malay Language Unit Goal</h4>

<p></p>
<h3>FRAMEWORK &amp; PEDAGOGICAL APPROACHES</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Key Programmes &amp; Learning Experiences</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Intensive Reading Programme: Mari Membaca Magazine</strong>
</p>
<p>Monthly subscription to Mari Membaca Magazine is part of our effort to
expose our students beyond narrative writing. With a variety of reading
content, colourful illustrations and an array of activities, students are
always excited to flip through their copies.</p>
<p>Our teachers create an extension to the reading material, curated to their
own class needs and learning. Differentiated Instructions based on the
same reading experience. Thus, providing equity to upscale students' general
knowledge that is beyond textbook.</p>

<p><strong>Extensive Reading Programme: Ceritera Arif Budiman Cilik</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of our curated Extensive Reading Programme (ERP), we have decided
to highlight our own talented writers on an <a href="https://sites.google.com/moe.edu.sg/ceriteraarifbudimancilik/hak-milik-terpelihara?authuser=0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">online platform</a>.
The purpose is:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To provide a relatable reading experience for our current students</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To motivate them to believe in their writing capability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To give a sense of accomplishment and pride to have their work published</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The writers and materials published on the website are truly from our
alumni. As there is no limit to the depth of compilation, our students
can look forward to seeing their best written work published for online
reading.</p>
<p>The curated website is another of our effort to encourage ownership amongst
our students. At the same time, doubling up as a unique T&amp;L tool for
our department teachers.</p>
<p>Beyong ERP, there are many other ways that this website can be used to
elevate learning amongst our students.</p>
<p>Also, it ensures cyber safety for our students, providing them with a
controlled online reading platform. Full authority is upon our department
to curate the content and accessibility of the website.</p>

<p><strong>Taman Herba Arif Budiman Cilik</strong>
</p>
<p>The Malay Department has put together a physical herb garden alongside
an official website. The official website features the plants that are
common and prominent in the Malay community.</p>

outdoor learning thereafter complete some follow-up activities in the computer
lab.</p>

information available for our students. It is also part of the Malay Department’s
effort in contributing towards cyber wellness for the students, by taking
ownership of the cyber contents shared with students.</p>

<p>Our curriculum design emphasizes on teaching the Malay language in a fun
yet meaningful way. The department introduces Malay Literature in the Malay
Language through music and films aligned to the Mother Tongue Language
Curriculum to develop active learners as well as proficient users of the
Malay Language. The department uses Malay folk songs and films to entice
the lower primary students to learn Malay literature. As they progress
to the middle primary level, exposure to Malay poetry takes place. At the
upper primary level, with more maturity, our students can dabble with scriptwriting,
which helps in composition writing skills.</p>

<p><strong>Starfish Programme - Yes! I can read!</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes! I can Read! is a programme tailored to the non-Malay or slower Malay
language readers. In our reading programme, we use our unique 3R method
(Read, Recognise and Repeat) to help our students in mastering the connection
between syllables and sounds (phonics) by experiencing their correlation
in meaningful contexts. In this programme, our students must be actively
engaged in the process, which can be achieved through various activities,
which spark the students to become active readers thus helping them to
read aloud the words with confidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Objectives:</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide pupils with basic
reading skills - identify letters, sound letters, pronounce syllables,
read words and understand the meaning of words</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To actively engage pupils in-class
activities</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help pupils follow lessons
more confidently</p>
<p><strong>Herbs &amp; Spices Garden@Yumin</strong>
</p>
<p>Herbs and spices have important culinary and medicinal uses. Students
will be able to explore different types of herbs and spices and learn more
about the many benefits these plants provide. They will be engaged in activities
that encourage them to ask questions and be inquisitive as well as experience
authentic learning through explorations. Students will be using their five
senses to learn about the culinary and medicinal uses of the various herbs
in this interactive garden.</p>
<p>ICT tools such as iPads are used to scan QR codes to access information
and quizzes to enhance students’ learning. Students will also be able to
build confidence, express their creativity in ‘Salad Making’ activities
and learn the technique of making presentations in front of the audience.
This activity will help to promote teamwork, critical thinking and leadership
skills in students.</p>
<p>Objectives:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To provide
Yumin Champs a rich language and cultural outdoor experience through learning
and recognising common herbs and spices in the Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To facilitate
holistic learning for students by engaging and creating meaningful outdoor
experiences that create a joy of learning. The programme will equip students
with the relevant skills and knowledge to be confident and effective communicators.
It will also cultivate a sense of care and graciousness for the environment
thus shaping their character and attitude through this experiential learning.</p>

<p><strong>Mother Tongue Fortnight &amp; Language Camp</strong>
</p>
<p>The MT Fortnight &amp; Language Camp is a multi-disciplinary platform
involving English, Physical Education, Art, Music, Drama and Character
and Citizenship Education (CCE). The learning of Malay Language is fun,
engaging and effective through an integrated setting.</p>
<p>Some activities done before are arts and craft such as batik painting
and tanjak making, learning to play the musical instruments like angklung
and kompang, learning malay traditional dances like zapin and tarian kipas
and also cooking Malay traditional delicacies such as roti kirai, kuih

in learning Malay culture and better equip them with the varied use of
the language in different contexts. Students learn to be more confident,
adaptable, innovative and resilient.</p>
<p>Students also had cultural exposure to the Chinese culture during Chinese
New Year Celebrations. Students learn how to make fans using hangbaos and
also learn the meaning behind each ingredient of the Yu Sheng before getting
to toss and taste it.</p>
