<p><strong>Vision:</strong> Every Yumin Champion to be a critical and creative
thinker</p>
<p><strong>Mission:</strong> Create a vibrant and nurturing environment for
all Yumin pupils where learning of Mathematics is meaningful and self-directed</p>
<p><strong>Teaching Approach:</strong> Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract</p>
<p>The Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (C-P-A) approach is an essential approach
in the mastery of Mathematics that builds on students' existing understanding
progressively. It involves the use of concrete materials and pictorial/representation
diagrams in authentic contexts to strengthen conceptual understanding.</p>
