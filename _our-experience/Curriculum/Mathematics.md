**Vision:**
Every Yumin Champion to be a critical and creative thinker

**Mission:**
Create a vibrant and nurturing environment for all Yumin pupils where learning of Mathematics is meaningful and self-directed


**Teaching Approach:**
Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract

The Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (C-P-A) approach is an essential approach in the mastery of Mathematics that builds on students' existing understanding progressively. It involves the use of concrete materials and pictorial/representation diagrams in authentic contexts to strengthen conceptual understanding.
