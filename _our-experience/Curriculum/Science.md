**CURIOUS SCIENCE LEARNERS - Garden Trails**

There are four themed gardens in our school.  They are the Butterfly Garden, Herb and Edible Garden,   Skyrise Garden, and Fernery.

_Garden Trails: Lower Primary_

Integration of English STELLAR Programme with the learning of nature and life in our gardens. Our students get to explore the gardens, sow seeds and even harvest.

In the process of understanding the biodiversity of plants in our garden, our students acquire ICT skills and apply them during Science lessons.

Our students learn Adaptation in Animals and Reproduction of Plants. Our audio-guided trail and QR codes allow them to explore the garden independently while learning about the various animals and plants.

We have reopened the WOW corner in Yumin Primary School! In efforts to drive the natural curiosity for Science in students, we roster students down to the WOW corner during recess. At the WOW corner, students are able to observe our school pets, the stick insects and mealworm beetle. They can also enjoy reading Science magazine and watch Science related shows!
