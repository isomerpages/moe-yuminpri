**CURIOUS SCIENCE LEARNERS - Garden Trails**

There are four themed gardens in our school.  They are the Butterfly Garden, Herb and Edible Garden,   Skyrise Garden, and Fernery.

_Garden Trails: Lower Primary_

Integration of English STELLAR Programme with the learning of nature and life in our gardens. Our students get to explore the gardens, sow seeds and even harvest.

Our students learn Adaptation in Animals and Reproduction of Plants. Our audio-guided trail and QR codes allow them to explore the garden independently while learning about the various animals and plants.
