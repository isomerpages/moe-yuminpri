<p><strong>Purpose of Social Studies</strong>
</p>
<p>Social Studies helps students to grow in knowledge, develop skills and
learn values through examining issues that are of concern to our society
and the world in which we live.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To develop students into informed, concerned and participative citizens</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Empower students to be confident, self-directed and active contributor</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Syllabus Design</strong>
</p>
<p>The syllabus is divided into three broad clusters as described below:</p>
<p>Cluster 1: Discovering Self and Immediate Environment (P1 &amp; P2)</p>
<p>Students will explore who they are and the roles they play in relation
to the people and places around them. They will also explore the customs
and traditions of some communities in Singapore. Students will not only
come to appreciate the cultural diversity in Singapore but also learn how
common experiences help unite us as a nation.</p>
<p>Cluster 2: Understanding Singapore in the Past and Present (P3 &amp; P4)</p>
<p>Students will learn about Singapore and the contributions of different
groups of people to the country's growth and independence. They will develop
an appreciation of Singapore and come to value the adaptability, resilience
and resourcefulness of its leaders and people.</p>
<p>Cluster 3: Appreciating Singapore, the Region and the World We Live In
(P5 &amp; P6)</p>
<p>Students will learn about Singapore as a nation and the contributions
of different people to its development. They will also develop an understanding
of Southeast Asia, Singapore's connections with the region as well as legacies
of civilisations in the world that can still be seen today.</p>

<p>The culture of inquiry, as seen above allows teachers and students to
understand their respective roles and responsibilities in order to develop
the dispositions necessary for an inquiry culture in the classrooms.</p>
<p><strong>P1 School Trail</strong>
</p>
<p>The Primary 1 students went around the school to learn more about the
school environment to introduce them to the school community, as covered
in the Social Studies syllabus. This hands-on approach enables students
to learn through experience.</p>

<p><strong>P6 - Lesson on Cuneiforms</strong>
</p>
<p>The Primary 6 students learnt about ancient Sumer's system of writing
known as cuneiforms during their Social Studies lessons. They had a hands-on
experience in creating their own cuneiforms. In doing so, students experience
the challenges and intricacies of creating a system of writing.</p>
