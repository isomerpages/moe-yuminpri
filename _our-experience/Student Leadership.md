<p>LEAD.SERVE.ACHIEVE</p>
<p>At Yumin Primary, our leadership philosophy is encapsulated by three key
principles: Lead, Serve, Achieve. These principles guide our students in
their personal growth and leadership journey.</p>
<p></p>
<p>FRAMEWORK</p>
<p>Student leadership at Yumin Primary is structured into three progressive
levels: Lead Self, Lead Peers, and Lead School. Each level is designed
to enhance students' skills through targeted activities and responsibilities,
from managing oneself to leading initiatives that impact the wider community.</p>

<p>KEY PROGRAMMES AND EVENTS</p>
<p></p>
<p>Students Leaders' Investiture</p>
<p>The Student Leaders' Investiture at Yumin Primary School is a formal ceremony
where appointed student leaders are officially recognised and inducted
into their roles. This significant event celebrates the commitment of these
students to lead their peers, serve the school community, and strive for
excellence in their responsibilities. It also serves as a public affirmation
of their roles, providing an opportunity for the school community, including
parents, to acknowledge and support the students in their leadership journey.</p>

<p>Student Suggestion Scheme (3S)</p>
<p>The Student Suggestion Scheme (3S) at Yumin Primary School is an initiative
designed to empower students by involving them in decision-making processes
that affect their school experience. This platform encourages students
to voice their ideas and suggestions for improving school facilities, programmes
and activities - to name a few. By fostering a participatory environment,
the scheme not only enhances student engagement but also cultivates a sense
of ownership and responsibility among the students towards their educational
journey in Yumin.</p>

<p>Led by the Prefect Executive Committee (PEXCO), Food from the Heart is
a collaboration project at Yumin Primary School where student leaders,
specifically the P6 Prefects, organise a food donation drive. This initiative
involves collecting, packing, and sorting food items, which are then presented
to the community. It is part of the school's service learning efforts,
allowing students to actively contribute to the community while learning
the values of service and responsibility.</p>

<p>PSL Leadership Role</p>
<p>Peer Support Leaders, or PSLs, play an important role in developing a
caring and inclusive culture in school. The PSLs work closely with the
teachers of the Student Leadership Team and the Form Teachers to provide
an additional layer of timely peer support and encourage early help-seeking
and positive coping strategies.</p>
