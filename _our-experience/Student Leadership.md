<p>LEAD.SERVE.ACHIEVE</p>
<p>At Yumin Primary, our leadership philosophy is encapsulated by three key
principles: Lead, Serve, Achieve. These principles guide our students in
their personal growth and leadership journey.</p>
<p></p>
<p>FRAMEWORK</p>
<p>Student leadership at Yumin Primary is structured into three progressive
levels: Lead Self, Lead Peers, and Lead School. Each level is designed
to enhance students' skills through targeted activities and responsibilities,
from managing oneself to leading initiatives that impact the wider community.</p>
