<p><strong>PSG @ Yumin</strong>
</p>
<p>Welcome to the Yumin Family! As members of PSG, we value the importance
of working closely with the school in fostering all-round development of
our children.&nbsp; Our objectives are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To promote a sense of community among school, parents and pupils</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To provide a platform for parents to provide feedback on school policies
and direction for the benefits of our pupils</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To encourage parents to participate in school programs/activities</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To this end, we have been supporting annual school events like Sports
Carnival and P2 Speech &amp; Drama Showcase. We would like to take this
opportunity to invite you to join us as we work together in mutual trust,
respect and understanding.</p>
