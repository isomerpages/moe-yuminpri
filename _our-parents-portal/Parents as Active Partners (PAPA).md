Welcome to the Yumin Family! As members of PAPA, we value the importance of working closely with the school in fostering all-round development of our children.  Our objectives are:  

*   To promote a sense of community among school, parents and pupils
*   To provide a platform for parents to provide feedback on school policies and direction for the benefits of our pupils
*   To encourage parents to participate in school programs/activities

To this end, we have been supporting annual school events like Sports Carnival and P2 Speech & Drama Showcase. We would like to take this opportunity to invite you to join us as we work together in mutual trust, respect and understanding.

To be part of our family, please complete the [PAPA Membership Application Form](https://yuminpri.moe.edu.sg/qql/slot/u203/images/pages/our_partners/PAPA/PAPA%20application%20form.docx) and return it to the school general office.  If you have any concerns, please feel free to email us at [yumin\_ps@moe.edu.sg](mailto:yumin_ps@moe.edu.sg) .
