**History**&nbsp;

Yumin Primary School has her roots in two Chinese village schools, 'Yook Kiau' and 'Ping Min', in the old Tampines area from 1940 to 1974. The two schools merged in 1975 and was renamed 'Yook Min Primary School'. It was relocated to the present site in 1985 and renamed Yumin Primary School'. In 2003, the school was upgraded under PRIME programme.

 
Currently the school has an enrolment of 1283 pupils of different ethnic groups. The school offers Chinese, Malay and Tamil languages as mother tongue languages for pupils.




**Song**

We are one big family, we will strive for our country,
With the education we receive from a school that's heavenly.
We will study hard for sure, with the will to go forward,
With this book to show the way
We'll make and take the highest grade.

We are proud, we are proud, we are proud, we are proud,
We are proud of Yumin Primary School, a school that helps us all.

Our School will be our pride, it's a pride that's only right,
This is one thing we will dearly hold and will hold with all our might.
We will study hard for sure, with the will to go forward,
With this book to show the way
We'll make and take the highest grade. 

We are proud, we are proud, we are proud, we are proud,
We are proud of Yumin Primary School, a school that helps us all.
