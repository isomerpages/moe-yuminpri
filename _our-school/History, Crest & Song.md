**History** 

Yumin Primary School has her roots in two Chinese village schools, 'Yook Kiau' and 'Ping Min', in the old Tampines area from 1940 to 1974. The two schools merged in 1975 and was renamed 'Yook Min Primary School'. It was relocated to the present site in 1985 and renamed Yumin Primary School'. In 2003, the school was upgraded under PRIME programme.

 
Currently the school has an enrolment of 1283 pupils of different ethnic groups. The school offers Chinese and Malay languages as mother tongue languages for pupils.

The gear is an essential component in a machine. It keeps rotating until the product has been completed. Then it will turn again yet and yet again to manufacture new products.  Thus, the gear with an open book illustrates the endless search for knowledge with perseverance and determination.  

  

**Song**

We are one big family, we will strive for our country,

With the education we receive from a school that's heavenly.

We will study hard for sure, with the will to go forward,

With this book to show the way

We'll make and take the highest grade.

  

We are proud, we are proud, we are proud, we are proud,

We are proud of Yumin Primary School, a school that helps us all.

  

Our School will be our pride, it's a pride that's only right,

This is one thing we will dearly hold and will hold with all our might.

We will study hard for sure, with the will to go forward,

With this book to show the way

We'll make and take the highest grade.

  

We are proud, we are proud, we are proud, we are proud,

We are proud of Yumin Primary School, a school that helps us all.
