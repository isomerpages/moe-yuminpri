Greetings from Yumin Primary School

Yumin Primary school is 48 years old this year, and I am indeed privileged to join the Yumin family to continue the good work of the Principals before me so that we can continue to inspire every Yumin Champion to be a Confident and Effective Communicator, a Creative and Critical Thinker and a Caring and Gracious Citizen.

Every child is unique and talented in their own ways. Every child can and want to learn. Every child matters. These are our beliefs that will continue to guide the school as we strive to enable each child to flourish through our unique Yumin school experience that is anchored on Positive Education. Through CHAMPS (**C**herishing Relationships, Healthy Individuals, **A**ccomplishment and **P**ride, **M**eaningful Actions, **P**ositive Emotions and **S**trong Engagement), we hope to provide a holistic education for all our Yumin Champions, so that everyone will be given the opportunity to be developed in in various domains through various platforms such as &nbsp;the school’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP) and Applied Learning Programme (ALP)&nbsp; which are in the areas of STEM, and Community Service and Student Leadership respectively. The students have shared with me that they enjoy coming to school each day and appreciate the learning opportunities given to them.

With the shifts in education – from learning beyond school to learning throughout life, learning beyond grades to learning for mastery, and learning beyond for work to learning for life, I am committed to carrying on the good work made possible by the team of experienced and nurturing staff at Yumin Primary. Education is a social leveler, and together, we will continue to provide the necessary support for every child to learn, and a schooling experience that is holistic and anchored on values so that it will put them in good stead to navigate the fast-changing environment of today and the future. We strive to provide a nurturing culture of care as Yumin continues to be a second home for our staff and students.

As the saying goes, ‘It takes a village to raise a child’. Yumin Primary School could not have achieved what it has today without the support of our stakeholders. Thank you, parents, members of the Parents Support Group and the School Advisory Committee, for journeying with us. I look forward to deeper partnerships with everyone to deliver the Yumin education that brings out the best of each and every Yumin Champion!
