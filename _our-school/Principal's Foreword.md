Dear Parents    

  

Welcome to the 2022 school year. I am excited to welcome back our staff, students and parents for the new school year and a warm welcome to our 2022 P1 cohort.

We have chosen another exciting theme for our continuing Positive Education journey: Flourishing with a Growth Mindset!

  

Using this theme, we aim to teach our Yumin Champions that what we think and know makes a difference. We will provide both the stories and the science behind it. We hope to capture the students’ imaginations with the stories. Seeing other people demonstrate skills has a big impact on our beliefs that we too, can do it; the science research helps us back it up with evidence.
