<p>Yumin Primary School (YMPS) marks its golden anniversary this year, a
proud 50-year legacy of nurturing generations of young learners. As we
commemorate this milestone, we remain steadfastly committed to our founding
vision: bringing out the best in every child through strong values and
purposeful preparation for an ever-changing world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At YMPS, we believe emotional well-being forms the foundation of true
growth. We place the highest priority on creating a caring and supportive
environment for all our students. Our Positive Education approach - now
in its ninth year as an integral part of our school culture - guides this
commitment through our comprehensive CHAMPS framework: Cherishing Relationships,
Healthy Individuals, Accomplishment, Meaningful Actions, Positive Emotions,
and Strong Engagement. As we move forward, we remain dedicated to deepening
these practices to address the evolving needs of our students, ensuring
they thrive both academically and emotionally.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our educational philosophy, embodied in frameworks like 'Every Yumin Champion
Can Learn' and 'CCE@Yumin', reflect our unwavering belief that every child
can succeed, contribute, and lead. These, along with signature programmes
like 'THRIVE', 'Catalyst@Yumin', the 'Talent Programme@Yumin', and 'AEP@Yumin'
demonstrate our commitment to holistic development. Each initiative is
meticulously designed to nurture passionate, motivated learners equipped
with essential 21st-century competencies and the intrinsic drive to become
active contributors grounded in strong moral values. Yet what truly defines
the Yumin experience transcends frameworks and programmes -- it is our
culture of care and belonging that transforms our school into a vibrant
community where every student feels valued, supported, and empowered to
reach their fullest potential.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our exceptional achievements would not have been possible without the
dedication of our passionate staff and the steadfast support of our School
Advisory Committee and parents, particularly our Parent Support Group.
I am profoundly grateful for the trust, partnership and shared vision that
enable us to walk this journey together.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As we honour our past and boldly embrace the future, I am deeply privileged
to serve alongside this exceptional community. Together, we will continue
to nurture flourishing champions, future-ready learners, and caring citizens.</p>
