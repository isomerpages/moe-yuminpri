Dear Yumin Alumni, 

Please note that **all staff will not be in school after school dismissal (2 p.m.) on 28, 30 and 31 August 2023 (Mon, Wed and Thu)**. 

If you would like to visit your ex-teachers to send them your well wishes for teachersâ€™ day, you may do so on 29 August (Tue). To ensure that your trip to Yumin Primary is a fruitful one, please do get in touch and schedule an appointment with your ex-teachers before coming down as they may be having classes after school and/or may not be in school that afternoon.

Alternatively, you may also access the following link (https://www.yuminpri.moe.edu.sg/words-of-gratitude-for-yumin-staff/) to pen gratitude messages and well wishes for the teachers and any other staff members (office staff, cleaners etc) who may have touched your lives in one way or another. This link is accessible by parents/guardians, current and ex-students throughout the year, and will definitely go a long way to put a smile on the faces of our Yumin staff!
