_"My years as a member of Yumin School Advisory Committee (SAC) have enabled me to see how the school plans and manages its programmes to benefit each and every one of its Champions. These programmes, be it in the areas of academic, arts or sports, bring out the best in every pupil._
  
_What is heartening is **Yumin’s efforts in ensuring that no child is left behind,** especially pupils from financially disadvantaged family background. When the government assistance schemes cannot help these pupils, the SAC funding scheme will be utilized where possible. I commend Yumin’s efforts at doing their best to assist all children regardless of their race, nationality or family background._

_Yumin has a team of committed and dedicated teachers. What strikes me most is how the teachers effectively communicate with parents through various avenues such as the pupil’s handbook, emails, phone calls and Meet-the-Parents sessions._

_I can truly say that my journey with the SAC has been fruitful. I am very encouraged to see ALL TEACHERS IN YUMIN really caring for OUR CHILDREN._

_Thank you, Yumin for being part of our family’s learning journey!_"
